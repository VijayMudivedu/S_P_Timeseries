-----------------------------
#Business Understandading
-----------------------------
Business objective:

Please apply any machine learning algorithm you are comfortable with for predicting this time series

The results would be measured on:

1. Accuracy - How good are predictions

2. Visualization - How well are you able to convey your idea graphically

3. Code Cleanliness - How well have you documented your code in an easy language to understand. No need for excess code

Read Data from the CSV

```{r read data}
sp_historical_data <- read.csv(file = "Data/historical_data.csv")
dim(sp_historical_data)
head(sp_historical_data)
str(sp_historical_data)
```

## Data Understanding
-----------------------------

### DATA PREPARATION 

### Remove Unwanted Columns

 Remove the redundant columns symbol, name, class_type_of  "SPY", "SPDR S&P500", "S_P_500"

```{r}
sp_historical_cleaned <-
  sp_historical_data[,-which(names(sp_historical_data) %in% c("symbol", "name", "class_type_of"))]
head(sp_historical_cleaned)

```

 Check for NAs ----
```{r}

sapply(
  sp_historical_cleaned,
  FUN = function(x)
    sum(is.na(x))
)
```

 Comments: NAs found in Lead_1, Lead_2 and Lead_10
















## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
